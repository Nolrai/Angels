_Angels_ of our Better Futures

PC's are agents/avatars/daemons sent down to base reality/Earth/2019/The Hull from a post human Eutopia/Heave/Moon Base/Collective Reality.

You have monstrous powers, and inhuman insight, but the world is so sooo broken. It hurts. It hurts a lot. It hurts the most that most humans don't even have a clue how broken they are, their world is, how much they are missing out.

But HEAVEN needs you, its post-scarsity economy can't afford to help you much, your raw existance here is lost oprotunity more then you can understand, anymore.

But you are here to _help_ to fix things. To make things _better_. To do this you have 3 kinds of resource:
- You are almost? unkillable. This is less useful then in most games.
- You have your Orders from On High, you can't quite see the logic behind these sometimes, but they expose vampires/dark-spirits/powers that be, disasters before they happen, weak points in on-going tragedies. Less commands then priorities and information. (Access to plot hooks/DM insight/Prophesy) They trust your loyalty.
- Field Kit/Insight - 'Powers' inhuman skill, pheromones, infiltration into the highest levels, manipulation of records, abuse of physics
- Logistics - mundane people and things - so fragil and cruel, you want to fix them but you need their help.
